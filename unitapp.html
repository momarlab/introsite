              <p>Background Information regarding the Administration of Digimarketing Systems Limited (trading as "UnitApp"):<br>
<br>
A Board Meeting of Digimarketing Systems Limited was held by former Sole Director Tjeerd Romijn (Amsterdam), on July 31st, 2015 followed by the signing of a Notice of Intent August 2nd, 2015 and the official filing of the Notice of Intent to appoint Administrators at the High Court of Justice on August 3rd, 2015.<br>
<br>
Additional Notices of Intent to appoint administrators were filed by former Director Tjeerd Romijn in the following weeks before Digimarketing Systems Limited was placed in Administration and joint administrators Carl Bowles and John Dickinson of Carter Backer Winter LLP have been appointed on September 11th, 2015.<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB LIMITED has purchased all assets including but not limited to the Intellectual Property Rights, Domains and Source Code of Digimarketing Systems Limited (trading as UnitApp, now in Administration) in a pre-pack administrative sale/purchase immediately after the administration began.<br>
<br>
With several contractors MOMARLAB is in the process of transferring all the assets into the new company. Due to the rather complicated structure of the deal with former trading company, former Director and former employees based in Amsterdam, Administrators and Legal Entity being based in the UK and crucial accounts of Digimarketing Systems Limited (in Administration) with Google, Apple and other companies based in the USA and other countries, it is not possible to estimate how long the transfer will take, before MOMARLAB can start doing  business with the acquired assets. <br>
<br>
All former staff has to our knowledge been informed of the administration and despite several efforts by MOMARLAB, by our service partners and by our local legal advisors in Amsterdam, none of the staff employed on September 11th, has agreed to meet or talk to representatives of MOMARLAB.<br>
<br>
The former director Tjeerd Romijn is by shareholder contract bound to non-competition and non-solicitation for 12 months until after the company Digimarketing Systems Limited will have been dissolved. Since the company is currently still active and under administration, such period has not yet begun to shorten. <br>
<br>
All former staff is by contract bound to non-disclosure of trade and business secrets for several years.<br>
<br>
Should you be offered any of the intellectual property of Digimarketing Systems limited including any Source Code or trade secrets, or any other business by the former director Tjeerd Romijn or the former employees in any way that may give you reason to believe that their actions may be injuring the spirit of such non-competition or non-disclosure agreements, please be advised to contact MOMARLAB as a courtesy, the administrators for legal clarification and the local authorities in case you suspect to be offered an involvement in an illegal act.<br>
<br></p>
