<br>
<br>
October 22nd, 2015 (39 days since the begin of administration)<br>
MOMARLAB contacted the administrators and requested updates on strategy and time-lines regarding the delivery of the missing assets.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 19th, 2015 (36 days since the begin of administration)<br>
MOMARLAB has agreed with the former landlord of the company that all assets and files shall be picked up immediately upon the return of the landlord to Amsterdam from a travel abroad. The scheduled pick-up date will be on October 30th, 2015. This will be the first time and 47 days after administration began on September 11th, 2015 that MOMARLAB shall receive access to the former office and its property stored within as well as access to the potentially vital data on devices and in files at the former trading premises.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 16th, 2015 (33 days since the begin of administration)<br>
The joint administrators confirmed having negociated a termination of the lease agreement with the landlord of the offices at Falckstraat 15-29 in Amsterdam without enabling MOMARLAB to remove all assets stored at the office prior to cancellation and without removing any files remaining property of the company and needed by the administrators to aid their investigations into the conduct of the Company and Director. Instead MOMARLAB was requested to arrange for the removal of assets and deliver the details. Once records have been collected, MOMARLAB was requested to provide the administrators with a detailed list of the books and records recovered from the former trading premises. <br>
<br>
<br>
October 15th, 2015 (32 days since the begin of administration)<br>
MOMARLAB stood ready for the confirmed phone call on September 15th, but the call did not take place.<br>
No response in the matter was given by the administrators.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 14th, 2015 (31 days since the begin of administration)<br>
MOMARLAB contacted the administrators and requested confirmation of a phone conference scheduled for September 15th or the alternatively offered schedule on September 14th.<br>
MOMARLAB stood ready for the offered phone call on September 14th, but the call did not take place. <br>
No response in the matter was given by the administrators.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 12th, 2015 (29 days since the begin of administration)<br>
MOMARLAB contacted the administrators and requested updates regarding the status of asset-delivery and requested confirmation of a phone conference scheduled for September 15th, 2015. No response in the matter was given by the administrators.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 9th, 2015 (26 days since the begin of administration)<br>
MOMARLAB had a phone conference with the administrators and their agent and explained the importance of the missing assets and requested updates regarding the status of asset-delivery. A weekly communication by phone was agreed upon to be continued wit a phone conference scheduled for September 15th, 2015. <br>
<br>
Later that day MOMARLAB send documents supporting the call to the administrators and requested updates regarding the status of asset-delivery and requested confirmation of a phone conference scheduled for September 15th, 2015. <br>
<br>
No response in any matter concerning the business and customers of Unitapp was given by the administrators post the call. The administrators through their legal representative engaged in addressing formalities regarding the Sales and Purchase Agreement.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 8th, 2015 (25 days since the begin of administration)<br>
MOMARLAB is confirmed a phone conference with the administrators for October 9th, 2015.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 6th, 2015 (23 days since the begin of administration)<br>
MOMARLAB reminds the administrators regarding the phone call and is informed that Carl Bowles is on sick leave and is expected to be away from the office for a couple of days and that therefore the call should be at the end of the week.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 5th, 2015 (22 days since the begin of administration)<br>
No time slots for a phone call are offered by the administrators despite the forecast to do so on this day.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 2nd, 2015 (19 days since the begin of administration)<br>
The administrators have again been contacted to agree to a phone call in the matter. Such request was agreed to for the first time, and MOMARLAB was informed to be offered time slots for such a call on October 5th.<br>
<br>
Burak Canboy has tried to convince the Romijn family through contact with Tjeerd Romijn's brothers Ronald Romijn and Jelle Romijn of Land Rover B.V. to allow a meeting with the head of the family to address this matter in a non-business environment. No reply from the Romijn family to date.<br>
<br>
<br>
October 1st, 2015 (18 days since the begin of administration)<br>
MOMARLAB convinced the first and only service provider to date only after extensive written communication in the prior days to at least change the associated security phone number to a new phone number which is in MOMARLAB's posession. This is to date only the first of 14 service providers who actively agreed to allow access to prior content of Digimarketing Systems Limited. Unfortunately for the customers this is merely an account dedicated to sales.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 23rd, 2015 (12 days after administration came in effect)<br>
MOMARLAB is informed by ArgewebNL (owned by KPN)<br>
"As long as we do not receive instructions to the contrary from either mr. Romijn or a court ruling, KPN will not transfer any rights to MOMARLAM LIMITED. "<br>
<br>
<br>
September 22nd, 2015 (11 days after administration came in effect)<br>
The administrators have been informed by MOMARLAB's legal representative in England, Paddy Gregan of BrookeStreet des Roches that<br>
<br>
"We are at a loss to understand why it has taken so long for the Administrators to react or take any steps to bring this director under control. We seem to have had to drive every complaint and evidence the lack of cooperation, which has only served to undermine the goodwill and prospects for this business. Something as simple as getting the keys back from Tjeerd or ensuring that he had already given you correct access codes and the like have been wholly ignored and left unresolved."<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB "is aghast and concerned that there is little bite or real intent to pursue these matters fully diligently and thoroughly and we hope and expect that to change materially and markedly. <br>
<br>
We think it is entirely reasonable to expect to see real progress and results relating to the Employees, the Domain names, other company property to be handed over, access to the premises (still the Company’s premises) [..]<br>
<br>
I strongly suggest that the Administrators liaise with Burak who has people in Amsterdam if you need any help in that regard.<br>
<br>
It has been said before and we repeat that the Administrators really need to look into the activities of this director because something is very wrong in how this is evolving."<br>
<br>
Later that day we received information and several resignation letters forwarded to us through the administrators. All resignation letters were dated September 11th, 2015, but the exact wording and other reference indicates that such letters were probably issued on September 22nd and were back-dated in a collaborated effort together with the director. Also there is no reference so far in why the employees have already laid down their work on September 4th and formally resigned one week later.<br>
<br>
There is to date also no reference why the employees laid down work on September 4th or even September 11th, claiming to do so after being informed of the bankruptcy and not being paid even though there is indication that all employees were paid their open back-pay in the days prior to the administration coming into effect. <br>
<br>
MOMARLAB has indirectly and without evidence been informed that the former employees of Digimarketing Systems Limited are waiting at home to receive orders from Tjeerd Romijn on what venture to engage in next. There is to date no indication that the former team has taken employment elsewhere.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 21st, 2015 (10 days after administration came in effect)<br>
All service providers have been reminded to reply to the initial request sent on September 11th. Until that date none of the service providers had even replied to MOMARLAB's request. After the reminder, all service providers have refused to transfer the accounts to MOMARLAB without the written consent of former account holders or court orders. So far such written consent has not been provided. MOMARLAB is in preparation of filing for court orders.<br>
<br>
The administrators have been informed that the Dutch Chamber of Commerce's public business registry shows no indication of the administration and that the former Director is still listed as legally representing the company as sole director. We are to date not aware of an update in the matter.<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB requested the administrators as the legal representatives of Digimarketing Systems Limited (in administration) to engage in exchanging locks to the office at Falckstraat in order to allow access to the assets purchased by MOMARLAB and to such that may potentially be vital data to allow continuation of business. The administrators have left that request unanswered and informed MOMARLAB of the cancellation of the rent agreement with the former landlord on October 16th, 2015 (see details above).<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB was informed that the administrators shall ask for invoices from Argeweb NL pursuant to section 235 and for all the other information requested by letter next morning. No update in the matter to date.<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB was also informed that the Administrators contacted Tjeerd Romijn and all of the known employees and advised that they need to contact MOMARLAB by 10am (BMT) next  day to clarify their employment status with MOMARLAB or else resign. <br>
<br>
<br>
September 19th, 2015 (8 days after administration came in effect)<br>
Argeweb NL is informed that MOMARLAB will check if the fact that their refusal to resend invoices of accounts of which payments have been collected in the past can be covered under the law of data protection or may have to be considered an unnecessary business obstruction in a bancruptcy proceeding.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 18th, 2015 (7 days since the administration came in effect)<br>
MOMARLAB re-requested missing access and content as well as an outlook on when such may be delivered. We offered to set up a co-working environment to accelerate the delivery of assets and sharing information gathered instanty. No reply to date.<br>
<br>
The administrators were reminded of the statutory powers and duties that the administrators have to require Tjeerd Romijn and the employees to cooperate. We have pressed to know what steps are being undertaken and what the administrators' plan is.<br>
<br>
We  have been informed that the Administrators have written a letter to all employees known to them to advise of the fact and the effect of TUPE, such that if they wish to resign they must do so formally in writing to MOMARLAB as the new owner/employer.<br>
<br>
In addition the administrators have agreed they will send a letter to Tjeerd Romijn to remind him of his obligations to provide information and documentation which belong to the Company. MOMARLAB reminded the administrators of the Insolvency Act 1986 (IA1886), under which Tjeerd Romijn has a legal duty to assist the administrators (section 234 IA86)  in the pursuance of their duties to get in the assets of the company (section 235 IA86).<br>
<br>
The landlord was contacted again to offer access but informed us that he needs to check the legal implications first before allowing anyone to remove anything from the premises.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 17th, 2015 (6 days since the administration came in effect)<br>
MOMARLAB informed the administrators that we have not yet heard back from them regarding the employees' contact details and the legal situation of the employees of Digimarketing Systems.<br>
<br>
We have requested clarification and contact details to investigate if we can convince any of the employees to continue and inform the employees regarding the implications the change of ownership of intellectual property rights may have for them.<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB has offered to exepite the process regarding matters involving the former Director and former employees by involving MOMARLAB's legal representative Joost Quant of Lexsigma in Amsterdam. This offer has to date not been replied to.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 15th, 2015 (4 days since the administration came in effect)<br>
MOMARLAB finished in-depth analysis of the access data and assets provided by the administrators on the previous day and informed the administrators of the missing information, missing assets and indications of recent alteration and removal of assets just prior to the administration coming in effect. MOMARLAB has requested a reply by 6pm the same day. MOMARLAB has to date not been provided with additional passwords or assets by the administrators.<br>
MOMARLAB offered a phone call to discuss the matter. The request was not replied to.<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB had an appointment and visited the managing director of Argeweb.nl at the Maassluiss office to clear formalities regarding the transfer of all domains used for the Unitapp platform, paid for by Digimarketing Systems Limited but administered by the former Director Tjeerd Romijn. Argeweb explained it cannot cooperate in the matter in any helpful way because of Dutch Data Protection rights preventing Argeweb from disclosing any information to MOMARLAB without the former Director's consent. MOMARLAB was delivered with a consent form to be signed by the Director. The consent form has immediately been forwarded to the administrators but to date there has been no progress in the matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 14th, 2015 (3 days since the administration came in effect)<br>
MOMARLAB was delivered by the administrators with an incomplete and faulty list of access details to accounts and assets of Digimarketing Systems Limited provided to them by former Director Tjeerd Romijn and forwarded to MOMARLAB without prior validation by the administrators.
Director Tjeerd Romijn requested MOMARLAB should restrain from contacting any of the former employees of the company and explained all former employees had left the company without providing any proof thereof.<br>
MOMARLAB immediately checked the list and reported multiple faulty and missing passwords, accounts and assets to the administrators. MOMARLAB has to date not been provided with additional passwords or assets by the administrators.<br>
No employees were present at the Digimarketing's premises at Falckstraat on the first business day after the administration came in effect and no access to MOMARLAB was given to the office.<br>
<br>
The landlord informed us that he could not get in contact with Tjeerd Romijn and that we shall speak again later.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 12th, 2015 (1 day after administration came in effect)<br>
The landlord informed us that he could not get in contact with Tjeerd Romijn and that we shall speak again on Monday, September 14th.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 11th, 2015 (the day administration came in effect)<br>
MOMARLAB and the proposed administrators contacted the landlord of the office at Falckstraat and informed him of the upcoming purchase/sale and that MOMARLAB would require access to the premises to pick up its assets. The landlord informed us that he has no spare keys and that he would need to discuss details of the hand-over with director Tjeerd Romijn first and that MOMARLAB would be informed the next day.<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB and the proposed administrators signed a purchase and sale agreement. Digimarketing Systems Limited was placed in administration. The proposed administrators were appointed administrators.<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB contacted all Service Partners know on that date, provided them with a copy of the notice of administration and a copy of the sale and purchase agreement to transfer all accounts of Digimarketing Systems Limited to MOMARLAB.<br>
<br>
MOMARLAB contacted all known employees of Digimarketing Systems Limited through the known email addresses and offered to continue their employment and reminded them that they need to come to work on the following Monday morning or send proof of their resignations. Former Director Tjeerd Romijn was copied in.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 10th, 2015 (1 day prior to administration)<br>
Burak Canboy revisits the office of Digimarketing Systems Limited in Amsterdam sereral times with nobody answering the door and the director refusing to meet.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 9th, 2015 (2 days prior to administration)<br>
An agent of the proposed administrators comes to Amsterdam to meet with Tjeerd Romijn and Burak Canboy to discuss the transfer of assets post the upcoming signing of a sale and purchase agreement. Two meetings are held with the agent of the administrators, however the director Tjeerd Romijn refuses to have a three-way meeting and prefers to talk to the agent alone. We find out later that Tjeerd Romijn made the second best offer during the bid and may therefore have been hoping that MOMARLAB does not go through with signing of contracts with the proposed administrators.<br>
<br>
We are informed that the office is empty and that no employees have come to work since September 4th.<br>
<br>
We find out later that the public whois registry of unitapp.com and other domains used by Digimarketing Systems Limited has been changed on this date in the following way: the address of the company was replaced with the home address of Tjeerd Romijn.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 8th, 2015 (3 days prior to administration)<br>
Burak Canboy revisits the office of Digimarketing Systems Limited in Amsterdam sereral times and is again left at the door of Digimarketing Systems Limited with no-one opening and the Director refusing to meet.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 7th, 2015 (4 days prior to administration)<br>
Burak Canboy revisits the office of Digimarketing Systems Limited in Amsterdam sereral times and is again left at the door of Digimarketing Systems Limited with no-one opening and the Director refusing to meet.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 4th, 2015 (7 days prior to administration)<br>
Burak Canboy revisits the office of Digimarketing Systems Limited in Amsterdam several times and is again left at the door of Digimarketing Systems Limited with employees refusing to open and the Director refusing to meet.<br>
<br>
Digimarketing Systems Limited Employee Michael Tiel as self-declared spokesman of the entire Digimarketing Systems Staff declared by email in the evening that the team has become aware of the Burak Canboy/MOMARLAB offer being the best offer on the assets of the company and that the staff is not interested in any co-operation with a new owner other than Tjeerd Romijn and has warned Burak Canboy that a purchase of the assets of the company without the continuation of employment of Tjeerd Romijn would result in all staff members leaving the company and leaving only an empty shell.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 3rd, 2015 (8 days prior to administration)<br>
Burak Canboy manages to have a phone call with proposed administrator Carl Bowles while waiting in front of his CBW office building in London and is informed that there is nothing much the proposed administrators are able to do and that communication needs to go through the agents or the director who refuses to talk. The proposed administrator recommends to go back to Amsterdam as that is the place of business.<br>
<br>
Burak Canboy returns to Amsterdam and is again left at the door of Digimarketing Systems Limited with employees refusing to open and the Director refusing to meet.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 2nd, 2015 (9 days prior to administration)<br>
Burak Canboy visits London in order to have a meeting with the proposed administrators. Such meeting request is declined due to sick leave of Carl Bowles, no meeting with a different representative of CBW is offered despite Burak Canboy being merely 100m away of the office all day. Several phone calls are made instead with the agents of the proposed administrators in regard to the bid for assets.<br>
<br>
<br>
September 1st, 2015 (10 days prior to administration)<br>
Burak Canboy revisits the office of Digimarketing Systems Limited in Amsterdam sereral times and is again left at the door of Digimarketing Systems Limited with employees refusing to open and the Director refusing to meet. Instead Burak Canboy is requested by Tjeerd Romijn to stop waiting for Tjeerd Romijn in front of the office and is informed that the employees feel intimidated by his reluctancy. Burak Canboy is falsely accused of having enforced his entry to the office the prior day and is told that his visit was uninvited.<br>
<br>
<br>
August 31st, 2015 (11 days prior to administration)<br>
Burak Canboy visits the office in Amsterdam in the morning immediately after a flight from Shanghai. He is allowed upstairs very warmly welcomed by staff, asked if he wants to come into the office. He declines to enter the office as he would prefer to meet with Tjeerd Romijn as soon as he gets there but agrees to have coffee while waiting on the reception sofa and engages in small talk with some of the employees in the semi-public waiting area of the office. When beeing informed that director Tjeerd Romijn will not be able to see him due to medical examinations and asked to return in the afternoon, he agrees and has some more small talk with some employees in front of the office building over a cigarette.<br>
<br>
Burak Canboy revisits the office of Digimarketing Systems Limited in Amsterdam in the afternoon and is now told over the speaker-phone that the employees have been asked by Director Tjeerd Romijn to refuse him access to office despite Burak Canboy at that time being Supervisor of the Board of Directors, representative of the shareholder win.rar and holder of power of attorney to represent the majority of shareholders. After being granted access to the building by another visitor, Burak Canboy engages in communication with two employees in the semi-public area in front of the offices and requests a meeting with a representative of the employees as there is a chance that he may be representing the future owner of the company and as such may be employer or supervisor of the employees in the future. Both employees refuse to pass on that request to the other employees and ask to respect their position as having received clear directive from the director Tjeerd Romijn to not engage in any communication whatsoever with Burak Canboy.<br>
<br>
No response from director Tjeerd Romijn untill the afternoon of the next day.<br>
<br>
<br>
August 28th, 2015 (14 days prior to administration)<br>
MOMARLAB LIMITED is founded to participate in the bid for the assets and is registered at the Companies House in Cardiff with company number 09754368.<br>
<br>
<br>
Involvement of win.rar GmbH and other shareholders in the bidding process and prior to the administration:<br>
<br>
win.rar GmbH became a Shareholder of Digimarketing Systems Limited and invested into the company initially in Spring 2014 with the intent to globally market Digimarketing's UnitApp Platform. The investments through share purchases and convertible note into Digimarketing Systems Limited by win.rar GmbH were in excess of 200'000 Euro. win.rar GmbH until the very last second offered to continue funding Digimarketing Systems Limited in order to avoid administration but neither win.rar GmbH nor the other shareholders could convince Tjeerd Romijn that a bankruptcy is not a good solution for the company as it leaves not only creditors and shareholders with little or nothing but also puts the continuation with existing customers at risk, potentially even leaving customers who may have already paid waiting for products that will be delivered late or not at all. On the day the administration was initiated, offers to invest up to 450'000 Euros into the company immediately before or upon the begin of the administration through a group of former shareholders and investors did not lead to a different result. Based on the director's behaviour to refuse several shareholder meetings and due to the unclear outcome of a take-over with the director still in charge the shareholders agreed to pursue a continuation of the business. win.rar GmbH and the former shareholders did not engage in the bidding process over the assets but instead tried to convince the proposed administrators that the company should be administered instead of a pre-pack administrative sale and that the shareholders are willing to engage in communications regarding the best offer as soon as the administrator was appointed.<br>
<br>
Alexander Ganter as a private person who was invested into Digimarketing Systems with two Convertible Promissory Notes participated in the second round of the bidding process with a low offer. He did not participate in the last bidding round.<br>
<br>
Burak Canboy as a private person decided to make a bid through the independent and newly founded company MOMARLAB with an offer that to his best knowledge had the potential to cover all debts of the former company if the transfer of assets was conducted immediately and in its entirety. With any second that passes with the assets not having been transferred successfully and in their entirety and especially lacking the transfer of the abovementioned vital assets it becomes less likely that the agreement between MOMARLAB and the administrators may actually yield sufficient revenue to do so.<br>
<br>
Without any knowledge when such transfer may be completed, MOMARLAB is currently not in a position to forecast when it may be able to start conducting business on the platform UnitApp.<br>
<br>
About Burak Canboy:<br>
Burak Canboy has been in active in Sales and Marketing since 1992 and has started his first own company win.rar GmbH in 2002. Since April 2002 win.rar GmbH has been the exclusive global publisher of RARLAB WinRAR and is now based in Berlin. Burak Canboy is currently based in Shanghai, China. <br>
